# Prompt Evaluation

Analyze the user's prompts from this conversation. Be concise.

## Output

### Overall Score
```
Score: X.X/5
Prompts evaluated: N
High: X | Low: X
```

### Bottom 1-3 Prompts
Only the 1-3 weakest prompts:

```
"[truncated prompt]..." → X/5
Issue: [One sentence]
Better: "[Rewritten version]"
```

Skip this section if all prompts scored 4+.

### Quick Improvements
1-2 short phrases (not full sentences). Example: "Be more specific", "Avoid vague 'this'"

## Guidelines
- Skip trivial prompts ("yes", "thanks", "okay")
- Brief prompts are fine when context is established
- Focus only on prompts where improvement would have meaningfully helped
